# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Spotify Account Transfer Web Application

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Create a web application that enables users to transfer data from an old Spotify account to a new one without manual copying. The application will provide a simple interface for users to authenticate both accounts, select data categories to transfer, and execute the transfer process.

### 1.2 Target Users

- Spotify users who want to migrate from an old account to a new one
- Users who have created multiple accounts and want to consolidate their music data

## 2. Core Features (MVP)

### 2.1 Dual Account Authentication

- **OAuth 2.0 Integration**: Secure login for both old (source) and new (destination) Spotify accounts
- **Session Management**: Maintain authentication tokens for both accounts during the transfer process
- **Account Verification**: Display basic profile information to confirm correct accounts are linked

### 2.2 Data Category Selection

Users can select which data categories to transfer:

#### Available Categories:

- **Playlists**: All user-created playlists (public and private)
- **Liked Songs**: User's saved tracks
- **Followed Artists**: Artists the user follows
- **Followed Users**: Other Spotify users the user follows
- **Saved Albums**: Albums saved to user's library

#### Selection Interface:

- Checkbox interface for each category
- "Select All" / "Deselect All" options
- Preview counts for each category (e.g., "23 playlists", "1,247 liked songs")

### 2.3 Transfer Process

- **Preview Screen**: Summary of selected data before transfer
- **Transfer Execution**: One-click transfer initiation
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and retry options
- **Completion Summary**: Report of successfully transferred items

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Spotify Web API Integration

#### Required API Endpoints:

- **Authentication**: Authorization Code Flow
- **User Profile**: Get current user's profile
- **Playlists**:
  - Get user's playlists
  - Create playlist
  - Add tracks to playlist
- **Tracks**:
  - Get user's saved tracks
  - Save tracks for user
- **Artists**:
  - Get followed artists
  - Follow artists
- **Albums**:
  - Get user's saved albums
  - Save albums for user
- **Users**:
  - Get followed users
  - Follow users

#### API Limitations to Handle:

- Rate limiting (429 responses)
- Batch size limits (50-100 items per request)
- Private playlist restrictions
- Regional availability differences

### 3.2 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Authentication**: Spotify OAuth 2.0
- **Storage**: Session storage for temporary tokens
- **Deployment**: Web hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, or similar)

### 3.3 Security Requirements

- Secure token storage and handling
- HTTPS enforcement
- No permanent storage of user credentials
- Proper OAuth scope management

## 4. User Experience Flow

### 4.1 Authentication Flow

1. Landing page with "Start Transfer" button
2. "Connect Old Account" - OAuth login for source account
3. "Connect New Account" - OAuth login for destination account
4. Account verification screen showing both profiles

### 4.2 Selection Flow

1. Data category selection page with previews
2. Transfer confirmation page with summary
3. Transfer progress page with real-time updates
4. Completion page with transfer results

### 4.3 Error Handling

- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limit exceeded
- Authentication token expiry
- Partial transfer failures
- Duplicate content handling

## 5. Success Metrics

### 5.1 Functional Success

- Successful authentication of both accounts
- Accurate data retrieval and display
- Successful transfer of selected data categories
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 5.2 User Experience Success

- Intuitive interface requiring minimal instructions
- Clear progress indication throughout the process
- Helpful error messages and recovery options

## 6. Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)

### 6.1 Not Included in MVP

- Podcast subscriptions and episodes
- Recently played history
- User preferences and settings
- Collaborative playlist permissions
- Queue state transfer
- Offline downloads
- Custom playlist ordering preservation

### 6.2 Future Considerations

- Incremental/delta transfers
- Scheduled transfers
- Transfer history and logs
- Advanced filtering options
- Bulk account management

## 7. Technical Constraints

### 7.1 Spotify API Limitations

- Rate limits: 100 requests per minute per user
- Batch operations limited to 50-100 items
- Some data may not be transferable due to licensing
- Regional content availability differences

### 7.2 Development Constraints

- Must use Spotify Web API (no third-party scraping)
- OAuth 2.0 compliance required
- No permanent user data storage
- Must handle API deprecations and changes

## 8. Success Criteria

### 8.1 Minimum Viable Product

- [ ] Dual account authentication working
- [ ] Data category selection interface functional
- [ ] Transfer process for all core categories working
- [ ] Basic error handling implemented
- [ ] Progress indication during transfers

### 8.2 Quality Assurance

- [ ] All transfers complete successfully for test accounts
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] UI works across major browsers
- [ ] Performance acceptable for large libraries (1000+ items)

## 9. Timeline and Milestones
